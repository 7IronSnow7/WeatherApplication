# WeatherApplication

I developed a reliable weather application by utilizing external resources from the internet. 
To access real-time weather data, I integrated the OpenWeatherMap API, which provides comprehensive weather information. 
By leveraging this API, my application offers accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts to users. 
For more details about the OpenWeatherMap API and its capabilities, please visit their website at https://openweathermap.org/api.
